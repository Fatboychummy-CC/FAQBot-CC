** Too Long Without Yielding **

Computercraft has a builtin system which stops a single computer from running for too long at a time. After ~7 seconds of nonstop running, your computer will receive an error, `Too long without yielding`.

If, a few seconds after your program received the initial error, your program still has not yielded (ie: the error was caught by `pcall` or `xpcall`), the computer itself will shut down.

** How do I fix this? **

First, you need to figure out where your program is looping. The error itself may not be too helpful, as the `Too long without yielding `error points to the last line that was run before timing out (which could be OS code, or some other library's code). In most cases, you're looking for a `while true do` loop.

Once you find where it's looping forever, you can simply add `sleep()` or `os.sleep()`. In most cases this will fix the problem.

Ex:

```lua
while true do
  -- Your code here
  ...
  sleep()
end
```
